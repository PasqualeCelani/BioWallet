# BioWallet
A biometric based wallet for cryptocurrencies that leverages facial recognition to securely generate and retrieve cryptographic keys, eliminating the need for passwords or phrases. 
BioWallet is a **proof-of-concept** desktop application implementing a key release biometric cryptosystem, ensuring that private keys are only accessible after successful identity verification.

##  :rocket: Key Features

* üß† **Facial Recognition with Deep Learning:** Uses RetinaFace for detection and FaceNet512 for embedding generation;
* üîê **Key Release Cryptosystem**: Private keys are stored and released only after a successful verification;
* üìä **Quality Verification:** Integrates FaceQnet for automatic facial quality filtering of the samples submited either as probe or as templates in the gallery; 
* :key: **ECC-Based Key Generation:** Uses secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography for Bitcoin compatibility;
* üß™ **Experimental Validation:** Evaluated on AT&T and custom DB-1 datasets.
  * The two datasets used for evaluations and the FaceQnet pre-traid model can be downloaded from the following [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fQCNFnmyeTsDg8TEFWbBa0d8ynN5bO4w?usp=sharing). The FaceQnet pre-traid model must be placed in the following application directory ```BioWallet/app/backend/src/flask_docker/util/models```, and the dataset under ```BioWallet/datasets```. Moreover, a suit of scripts for running the evaluations are in the verification module of this repository ```BioWallet/verification```.
* :notebook_with_decorative_cover: **Documentation**: For a more detailed overview of the project, please refer to the main report available in the ```doc/main.pdf``` file within the repository.

## :gear: Build&Run
### Prerequisites
Having Docker and Docker Compose installed.
### Steps

1. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/PasqualeCelani/BioWallet.git```
2. Go to the application directory: ```cd BioWallet/app```
3. Start the application: ```docker compose up --build --force-recreate```
4. Open the application:  Open the following URL in your favorite browser ```http://localhost:3000```


## :warning: Limitations
While BioWallet demonstrates the feasibility of using facial biometrics for secure cryptographic key management, it currently remains a prototype and has several limitations that should be addressed in future development:

* **No Blockchain Integration**:  Only generates public and private keys and displays them, it does not handle addresses, transactions, or funds nor is it integrated with the Bitcoin blockchain;
* **Possibility of Spoofing**: There is currently no protection against spoofing attempts using photos or videos;
* **Desktop only**: Currently, the application's user interface is designed to be user-friendly and functional only on desktop devices;
* **Local host only**:  Currently, the application is not intended to run in a server environment due to potential security risks. While it is theoretically possible, it is not recommended, as potential threats have not been thoroughly evaluated.
